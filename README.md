# Planets-Aliens-Explosions
Text based space exploration board game (Python)

Player traverses a board of 0-7 planets by rolling a die, or specifying movement. On each planet player faces the inhabitant aliens and if player civ level >= alien civ level, the player gains rock samples. If the player lands on "Python planet" the game is over immediately and the player has won. The player loses fuel as they travel, and can die if alien civ level > player civ level. Multiple games can be played and then final stats are displayed.
